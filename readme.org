** Features

   - Elisp client for [[https://imgflip.com][imgflip]]
   - Snippets for org-mode that allow users to easily embed memes in their org files.
   
** Installation
   
   This plugin is not currently available on any repository, so the simplest way to install is via [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]].

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package imgflip.el :straight (imgflip.el :host github :repo "iocanel/imgflip.el")
      :custom (imgflip-download-dir "~/.imgflip" "Where my images will be downloaded"`)
      :config
      (setq imgflip-username "< your username >"
            imgflip-passowrd "< your password >"))
  #+END_SRC

** Using

*** Getting the top templates

  Using the function below you will get an alist with the top templates description and id's

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (imgflip-get-top-templates()
  #+END_SRC

  
*** Create and downalod an image
**** With a template id
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (imgflip-download-caption-image "<template id>" "<Top text (text0)>" "<Bottom text (text1)>")
   #+END_SRC

**** Without a template id

     To make it easier, the function can work without a template id, by passing a `template query string`.
     This will only work for templates in the `Top 100` list. Matching of the quesry string is done based on the most common words between the string and the template description.
     
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (imgflip-download-caption-image "Morpheus" "What if I told you..." "that it works even without a template id?")
   #+END_SRC
    

** Snippet

   An `imgflip` snippet is also provided for `org-mode` that gets as field values:
   
   - The template id or query string
   - The top text (text0)
   - The bottom text (text1)
     
   And expands to an org link to the downloaded image.
